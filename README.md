# Pong game
I made a pong game!
The paddles can de used by pressing the up/down keys (for the right player)
and the w/s keys for the left player.
There is a scoreboard that counts the points.
The speed of the ball increases when the game goes on.
NB: I made this project as a part of the udemy course "100 days of code", so it is not my original idea.
